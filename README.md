# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
Pewlett-Hackard is a company with an aging employee population who has requested an analysis to determine the number of retiring employees, which positions they currently fill, and which of them are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will give them direction on employee development so they can hire and/or promote enough people to replace retiring employees.

This exercise began with 6 original tables that had to be dissected & combined into additonal tables to find out the number of people getting ready to retire, and their positions. 

### Here are the original DataBases

### Here is new information that was gathered from combining different columns

## Results: 

* The number of employees retiring is 90,398, with the highest loss in the position of Senior Engineers (29,414).
* Of the employees retiring, 64% are senior level
* 1,549 employees eligible for mentorship.
* Even if they take full advantage of the mentorship eligible employees, there is a significant outflow of retiring employees that will require replacement, either through hiring or promotion from within.

## Summary:
Pewlett-Hackard will need to fill over 90,000 roles as the "silver tsunami" makes an impact.  There are not enough qualified employees to mentor the next generation of employees, so they will need to put a significant effort into recruitment, mentorship, and professional development in order to prevent a collapse of the experienced employee culture.
